## What distro should I use for Linux gaming?

The choice of a Linux distribution depends entirely on your preferences. There isn't a one-size-fits-all recommendation, but here are some widely popular, well-optimized, and community-favored options to consider.

### [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) based

Arch-based distros are the ones with the best support for gaming, but it may be overwhelming for beginners. If you don't know what you are doing, I wouldn't recommend any of those listed here.

Arch-based distros are intended to be used by advanced or semi-advanced users. Those are often referred to as "rolling-release" which means that packages and kernel is always up-to-date

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
- [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) - Often referred to as the user-friendly version of Arch Linux, EndeavourOS comes with the calamares installer for an easier setup experience.
- [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/) - "Gaming" distro
- [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) - Relatively easy to use Arch Linux. Comes with installer. Updates for Manjaro may not be always on time, due to their own [release system](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Manjaro:A_Different_Kind_of_Beast#Dedicated_Repositories).

### [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) based

Commonly known as the best linux distributions for beginners, Debian-based distributions are one of the most popular choices amongst them. However, they may come with outdated packages, as they offer stable-release system.

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) - One of the most commonly used distributions, based off Debian
- [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) - Best distro for beginners, highest rating on distrowatch.com, based off Ubuntu.
- [Pop_OS!](https://pop.system76.com/) - Made for beginners, based on Ubuntu

### [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) based

- [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)
- [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) - "Gaming" distro, same creator as Proton-GE

### Other/Advanced Distros

- [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) - For advanced users, you compile everything yourself
- [Funtoo](https://www.funtoo.org/Welcome) - A more optimized version of Gentoo
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) - Based on Nix Package Manager

## How does Linux gaming compare to Windows gaming?

While a lot of games are programmed only for Windows, [most of them](https://www.protondb.com/) run perfectly fine on Linux thanks to Proton, which is a collection of software and libraries combined with a patched version of [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/), a compatibility layer that translates Windows system calls to Linux ones.

Games made for Linux or designed to work on Linux usually run smoothly on the platform, occasionally outperforming their Windows counterparts. On the other hand, when running games not originally intended for use on Linux, the outcome may vary, dependant on factors such as your Linux distribution, installed tools, game, compatibility tools, and more.

## Optimizing the system for gaming

### Which kernel should I use?

The standard Linux kernel should sufice; however, if maximum performance is important to you, here are some recommended kernels:

- [linux-zen](https://github.com/zen-kernel/zen-kernel) - Most commonly used out of this bunch
- [XanMod](https://xanmod.org/) - Use real-time version
- [Liquroix](https://liquorix.net/)
- [Clear Linux](https://github.com/clearlinux-pkgs/linux) - Backed by and optimized for Intel ([not being discontinued](https://community.clearlinux.org/t/is-clearlinux-being-discontinued-no/8828), contrary to rumors)

### Proton

#### Installation

If you have already installed Steam, then you already have Proton, as it is also installed by default.

#### Enabling Proton

1. Go to Steam Settings
2. Click on the "Compatibility" tab
3. Turn on "Enable Steam Play for all other titles"

You can also switch your Proton version in this tab.

### Overclocking

### âš  **Warning**

> While overclocking has the potential to enhance system performance, it is strongly advised against unless you have a thorough understanding of the process. Proceeding with overclocking without adequate knowledge may lead to instability, overheating, and permanent damage to your hardware components.
